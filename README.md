# company-profit-prediction
This project aims to predict the profits of companies based on various factors such as their investments in research and development (R&D), administration costs, and marketing expenditures. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost regression, we develop a predictive model that analyzes historical data to forecast the profitability of companies.

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on R&D spending, administration costs, marketing spending, and the corresponding profits of 50 companies. Through exploratory data analysis, we gain insights into the relationships between these variables and identify patterns that can be exploited to build an accurate predictive model.

Using the XGBoost algorithm, we construct a regression model and fine-tune its hyperparameters through grid search and cross-validation techniques. This ensures optimal performance and generalization on unseen data. The trained model is then evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to assess its predictive accuracy.

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide companies with a reliable tool for forecasting profits based on their operational expenditures. By understanding the impact of different factors on profitability, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize resource allocation and maximize their financial performance.
